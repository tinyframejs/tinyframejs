# TinyFrameJS Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for [TinyFrameJS](https://github.com/AlphaQuantJS/tinyframejs) - an advanced, high-performance JavaScript framework tailored for processing large-scale tabular and financial data.

## About TinyFrameJS

TinyFrameJS is a powerful JavaScript library that provides a DataFrame-like API for efficient data manipulation and analysis. It is built on top of TypedArray-based memory management to enable low-latency, high-throughput operations, offering computational efficiency approaching that of systems implemented in native code, but with the accessibility and flexibility of JavaScript.

The main project repository is located at: [git@github.com:AlphaQuantJS/tinyframejs.git](https://github.com/AlphaQuantJS/tinyframejs)
